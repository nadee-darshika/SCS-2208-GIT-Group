<h1> About me</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2> 
I am Nirodha, I live in Galle. I went to S.T. Aloysius  College. I am an undergraduate at the University of Colombo, studying Computer Science.

<h2>Family</h2>
In our family, we are two siblings. I have a younger sister. Our family consists of my sister, my father and my loving mother.My father is a businessman whereas my mother is a schoolteacher. A lot of caring moments and love, is always what I get from everyone in my family.

<h2>Hobbies</h2> 
I love to study storybooks as a pastime. I am also learning cycling so that I can keep myself healthy. I believe, one should practice a lot of sports to keep oneself healthy. A healthy mind works better. So, it is very important to keep yourself healthy to get focused. I am also very fond of watching various movies, tv series and I love to watch cricket matches.

<h2>Goals</h2>
My future plans are having a job I enjoy doing, finding good life-work balance, foster good relationships both at work and in my personal life, and simply enjoy every day as it comes and goes. Of course, I plan to continue working on my language skills, because I want to become better in my work.
